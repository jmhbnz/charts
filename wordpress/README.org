[[https://wordpress.org][Wordpress]] is a free and open-source content management system paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system, referred to within WordPress as "Themes". WordPress was originally created as a blog-publishing system but has evolved to support other web content types.

I created this helm chart for self-hosting wordpress in a container on ~k3s~. Complete the steps below to deploy this chart.

#+NAME: Deploy wordpress via helm
#+begin_src tmate
# Ensure wordpress namespace exists
kubectl create namespace jamma-wordpress

# Create directories if they don't already exist
#mkdir --parent "/home/${USER}/Services/wordpress"

# Clone charts repository
#cd "/home/${USER}/Services/wordpress" && git clone https://gitea.jamma.life/jmhbnz/charts.git

# Ensure the repository is up to date
#cd charts/wordpress && git pull

# Install the chart
helm upgrade --install -n jamma-wordpress jamma-wordpress . \
    --set "ingress.hosts[0]=wordpress.jamma.dev" \
    --set "ingress.tls[0].hosts[0]=wordpress.jamma.dev" \
    --set "ingress.tls[0].secretName=tls-jamma-wordpress"
#+end_src

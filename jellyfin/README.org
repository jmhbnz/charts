[[https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin][Jellyfin]] is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support.

I created this helm chart for self-hosting jellyfin in a container on ~k3s~. Complete the steps below to deploy this chart.

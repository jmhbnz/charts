[[https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin][Jellyfin]] is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support.

I created this helm chart for self-hosting jellyfin in a container on ~k3s~. Complete the steps below to deploy this chart.

#+NAME: Deploy jellyfin via helm
#+begin_src tmate
# Ensure jellyfin namespace exists
sudo kubectl create namespace jamma-jellyfin

# Create directories if they don't already exist
mkdir --parent Services/jellyfin

# Clone charts repository
cd Services/jellyfin && git clone https://github.com/jmhbnz/charts.git

# Install the chart
helm upgrade --install -n jamma-jellyfin jamma-jellyfin charts/jellyfin \
    --set "ingress.hosts[0]=jellyfin.jamma.dev" 
    --set "ingress.tls[0].hosts[0]=jellyfin.jamma.dev" \
    --set "ingress.tls[0].secretName=tls-jamma-jellyfin"
#+end_src

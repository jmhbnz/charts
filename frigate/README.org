[[https://frigate.video/][Frigate]] is the network video recorder for monitoring security cameras with locally processed intelligence features.

I created this simplified helm chart for self-hosting frigate in kubernetes based on the excellent upstream [[https://github.com/blakeblackshear/blakeshome-charts][official helm chart]]. Complete the steps below to deploy this chart.

#+NAME: Deploy frigate via helm
#+begin_src tmux
# Set deployment environment
export environment=dev

# Create directories if they don't already exist
mkdir --parent "/home/${USER}/Services/frigate"

# Clone charts repository
cd "/home/${USER}/Services/frigate" && git clone https://gitea.jamma.life/jmhbnz/charts.git

# Ensure the repository is up to date
cd charts/frigate && git pull

# Install the chart
helm upgrade --install jamma-frigate . \
    --namespace jamma-frigate-${environment} \
    --create-namespace
#+end_src
